# MSMIL4Hyper
The source code of paper "Superpixel-Based Multi-Scale Multi-Instance Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification".

We use [HMS](https://github.com/psellcam/Superpixel-Contracted-Graph-Based-Learning-for-Hyperspectral-Image-Classification) for superpixel segmentation.

Then users can try `MSMIL` by running the following command:
```bash
python MSMIL_main.py run --dataset_name IP --train_ratio 0.03
```
